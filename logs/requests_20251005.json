AI agents are autonomous systems capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software, AI agents can: - Learn from experience - Adapt to new situations - Make decisions based on context - Interact with users naturally Key Components: 1. Perception: Gathering information from the environment 2. Reasoning: Processing information to make decisions 3. Action: Executing tasks based on decisions 4. Learning: Improving performance over time Types of AI Agents: - Reactive Agents: Respond to immediate stimuli - Deliberative Agents: Plan actions based on goals - Hybrid Agents: Combine reactive and deliberative approaches - Multi-Agent Systems: Multiple agents working together Applications: AI agents are used in customer service, autonomous vehicles, game playing, personal assistants, and industrial automation. They represent the future of intelligent automation.",

Poor crop selection and late diagnosis results in loss of yield and in worst case scenarios contribute to financial loss to farmers. Data-driven, farmer-centric solutions to these problems, derived from advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), are possible. This paper presents an AI-based web platform to support basic agricultural decision making with two core services, crop recommendation and plant disease identification. The crop recommendation model we developed uses a Random Forest classifier that has been trained on common soil and climatic parameters (N, P, K, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall) and achieves over ~95% accuracy in the 22 crop classes. We provide soil or soil treatment recommendations, crop rotation advice, dynamic smart advisory information using weather APIs, and a profit basis for ranking crops in our crop recommendation module, which are much broader than the recommendations made currently. The disease prediction module incorporates a Vision Transformer (ViT) which has been trained on the PlantVillage dataset containing 38 disease classes related to 15 crop species. To provide interpretability, we built our own ViT-GradCAM framework to generate visual explanations that will highlight diseased areas in leaf images to increase farmer trust in the predictions. In addition, the platform uses weather APIs, soil data, and economic analysis to provide context in decision making. Presently built in a nimble, web-based interface, the farmer can enter soil parameters to receive actionable insights or upload their image of a leaf to obtain recommendations. Unlike previous methods that have considered these issues separately, our integrated approach essentially combines both services into a single platform that is more usable and practical.
